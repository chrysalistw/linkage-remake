**Phase 1: Basic Grid Display** ‚úÖ
- [x] 6x8 tile grid with colored pipe symbols
- [x] GameBoard.gd main controller
- [x] Tile.gd individual tile logic
- [x] Integration with PlayScreen.tscn

**Phase 2: Input Detection** ‚úÖ  
- [x] Tile click detection with Area2D
- [x] Visual feedback on hover/click
- [x] Signal-based tile interaction

**Phase 3: Basic Drag Mechanics** ‚úÖ
- [x] DragHandler.gd for mouse/touch input
- [x] Row/column drag detection
- [x] Instant tile rotation mechanics
- [x] Visual drag indicators

**Phase 4: Connection Detection** ‚úÖ
- [x] detect.gd with LinkDetector class
- [x] All 10 pipe types connection logic
- [x] Recursive connection tracking
- [x] Green highlight visual feedback

**Phase 5: Tile Removal** ‚úÖ
- [x] Fade animation system (FadeSprites.gd)
- [x] Tile removal with fade effects
- [x] Random tile replacement
- [x] Score tracking (+1 per tile)
- [x] Chain reaction detection
- [x] Bonus moves system (1 per 3 tiles)

**Phase 6: Game State Integration** ‚úÖ
- [x] GameState.gd autoload singleton
- [x] Real-time UI updates (score/moves)
- [x] Game over detection and dialog
- [x] Reset/restart functionality
- [x] Signal-based architecture
