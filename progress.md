Based on the CLAUDE.md content and project status:

**Current Progress: ~75-80%**

**Completed (Phase 1-6):**
- âœ… Complete game mechanics (board, dragging, connections, scoring)
- âœ… Full game loop with moves/scoring/game over
- âœ… Clean component architecture
- âœ… Real-time UI integration

**In Progress (Phase 7):**
- ðŸ”§ Drag animation polish (active debugging needed)

**Missing for Commercial Viability (20-25%):**
- Proper sprite assets (using placeholder pipes)
- Sound effects/audio
- Particle effects and visual polish
- Performance optimization
- Game balancing/reward system

The core game is fully functional but needs polish assets and optimization to reach commercial quality (100%).
