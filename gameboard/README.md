# Gameboard Mechanics - Phase 6 Complete ✅

This folder contains the core gameboard mechanics for the Linkage puzzle game, converted from the JavaScript implementation to Godot 4.

**Current Status:** Phase 6 completed - Full game loop with UI integration, moves/scoring system, and game over detection working perfectly.

## Implementation Status

### Completed Phases ✅

**Phase 1:** Basic Grid Display - Static 6x8 tile grid with colored pipe symbols  
**Phase 2:** Input Detection - Tiles respond to mouse clicks with visual feedback  
**Phase 3:** Basic Drag Mechanics - Row/column dragging with instant rotation  
**Phase 4:** Connection Detection - Pipes connect and highlight properly  
**Phase 5:** Tile Removal - Fade animations, scoring, chain reactions complete  
**Phase 6:** Game State Integration - UI updates, game over detection, full game loop  

### Phase 6 Features ✅
- **GameState Autoload**: Configured as global singleton in project.godot
- **Real-time UI Updates**: Score and moves update instantly during gameplay
- **Game Over Detection**: Dialog appears when moves reach 0
- **Full Integration**: PlayScreen connects to GameState signals
- **Button Integration**: Reset/restart functionality through GameState
- **Single Source of Truth**: All game state managed centrally

### Next Phase ⏳
**Phase 7:** Polish & Features - Smooth animations, proper sprites, sound effects

## Current Game Features Working

✅ 6x8 tile grid with pipe symbols  
✅ Click and drag rows/columns  
✅ Connection detection with green highlights  
✅ Tile fade animations and removal  
✅ Score tracking (+1 per tile) with real-time UI updates  
✅ Moves tracking (-1 per drag) with real-time UI updates  
✅ Chain reactions and bonus moves  
✅ Game over detection and dialog  
✅ Reset/restart functionality  
✅ Complete game loop functional  

## Key Components

### GameBoard.gd
- Main controller managing the 6x8 tile grid
- Integrated with GameState singleton for moves/scoring
- Handles board initialization, tile creation, and drag operations
- Manages row/column rotation mechanics and fade animations
- Coordinates link detection and removal with chain reactions

### Tile.gd
- Individual tile representation with pipe type (faces 0-9)
- Area2D-based input detection with visual feedback
- Connection logic for 10 different pipe configurations
- Fade animation system with start/stop controls and signals

### DragHandler.gd
- Processes mouse/touch input for row/column dragging
- Provides visual feedback during drag operations
- Calculates temporary positions for drag previews
- Integrates with GameState for move counting

### GameState.gd
- Autoload singleton managing global game state (moves, score, game over)
- Signal-based architecture for real-time UI updates
- Game over detection and restart functionality
- Reward system integration ready

### detect.gd (LinkDetector class)
- Complete connection detection algorithm with recursive link tracking
- Handles all 10 pipe types with proper directional connections
- Implements tile removal with fade animations and scoring
- Chain reaction support for cascading tile removal
- Bonus move calculation (1 move per 3 tiles removed)

## Integration

**Already Integrated:**
1. ✅ GameState configured as autoload singleton
2. ✅ GameBoard connects to GameState for moves/scoring
3. ✅ PlayScreen UI connected to GameState signals
4. ✅ Button handlers use GameState methods
5. ✅ Real-time UI updates working

## Testing

**Complete Game Loop:**
1. Open PlayScreen.tscn in Godot
2. Run scene (F6) - Shows "MOVES LEFT: 100" and "SCORE: 0"
3. Drag rows/columns - Moves decrease in real-time
4. Create connections - Score increases immediately when tiles fade
5. Chain reactions - Multiple score updates, bonus moves awarded
6. Game over - Dialog appears when moves = 0
7. Reset - Game state returns to initial values

## Based On

This implementation follows the pseudocode specifications and maintains compatibility with the original JavaScript mechanics while leveraging Godot 4's scene system, signals, and autoload singletons.
