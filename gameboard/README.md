# Gameboard Mechanics - Phase 4 Complete ✅

This folder contains the core gameboard mechanics for the Linkage puzzle game, converted from the JavaScript implementation to Godot 4.

**Current Status:** Phase 5 completed - tile removal with fade animations, scoring, and chain reactions working. Backend mechanics complete.

## Implementation Status

### Phase 4 Completed Features ✅
- **Connection Detection**: Full algorithm implementation detecting pipe networks
- **Visual Feedback**: Green highlights and sprite tints for connected tiles
- **10 Pipe Types**: All pipe faces (0-9) connect properly according to rules
- **Recursive Algorithm**: Handles complex networks and loop detection
- **Debug Cleanup**: Production-ready code without debug noise

### Phase 5 Implementation Complete ✅

**All 5 Tasks Completed:**
1. ✅ Green Fade Animation Resource (FadeSprites.gd + green_fade_sprites.tres)
2. ✅ Basic Fade Animation in Tile.gd (start_fade_animation(), signals)  
3. ✅ Connection Detection Integration (fade triggers on connected tiles)
4. ✅ Tile Replacement & Scoring (random new faces, +1 score per tile)
5. ✅ Chain Reactions & Moves (moves counting, bonus moves, game over)

**Implementation Notes:**
- Fade animation has visual issues but functional
- Score/moves backend working correctly but UI not updating  
- All game mechanics confirmed working via console output
- Chain reactions and bonus moves system operational

### Ready for UI Integration
**Next Phase:** Connect GameState score/moves display to UI elements

## Key Components

### GameBoard.gd
- Main controller managing the 6x8 tile grid
- Handles board initialization, tile creation, and drag operations
- Manages row/column rotation mechanics
- Coordinates link detection and removal

### Tile.gd
- Individual tile representation with pipe type (faces 0-9)
- Area2D-based input detection
- Connection logic for 10 different pipe configurations
- Animation support for normal and fading states

### DragHandler.gd
- Processes mouse/touch input for tile dragging
- Supports horizontal and vertical row/column dragging
- Provides visual feedback during drag operations
- Calculates temporary positions for smooth previews

### GameState.gd
- Singleton managing global game state (moves, score, game over)
- Android WebView integration callbacks
- Sound system and asset management
- Reward system support

### detect.gd (LinkDetector class)
- Complete connection detection algorithm with recursive link tracking
- Handles all 10 pipe types with proper directional connections
- Implements tile removal and scoring logic (remove_links method)
- Chain reaction support for cascading tile removal
- Automated tile removal and replacement
- Scoring and bonus move calculation

## Integration

To integrate with existing screens:
1. Add GameBoard scene as child of PlayScreen
2. Configure GameState as autoload singleton
3. Connect gameboard signals to UI elements
4. Load tile sprite resources into Tile scenes

## Based On

This implementation follows the pseudocode specifications in `/pseudocode/` and maintains compatibility with the original JavaScript mechanics while leveraging Godot 4's scene system and built-in input handling.
