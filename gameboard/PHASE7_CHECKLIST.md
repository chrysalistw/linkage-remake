# Phase 7: Polish & Features Implementation Checklist

**Goal:** Add smooth animations, proper sprites, sound effects, and visual polish to match original game experience.

**Prerequisites:** Phase 6 complete - Full game loop with UI integration working

## Task Breakdown

### 1. Smooth Drag Animations üéØ
- [ ] Add Tween node to GameBoard.gd for row animations
- [ ] Add Tween node to GameBoard.gd for column animations  
- [ ] Implement smooth tile movement during drag operations
- [ ] Add visual feedback during drag preview
- [ ] Test animations don't interfere with game logic
- [ ] Ensure 60fps performance maintained

**Files to Modify:**
- `gameboard/scripts/GameBoard.gd` - Add Tween nodes and animation logic
- `gameboard/scripts/DragHandler.gd` - Integrate with animation system

### 2. Proper Sprite Assets üé®
- [ ] Locate existing pipe sprites in linkage/imgs/ directory
- [ ] Create new sprite resource files for each pipe type (0-9)
- [ ] Update PipeSprites.gd to load proper assets
- [ ] Replace temporary colored rectangles with actual pipe sprites
- [ ] Test all 10 pipe types display correctly
- [ ] Ensure sprites work with connection detection

**Files to Modify:**
- `gameboard/resources/PipeSprites.gd` - Update to load proper sprites
- `gameboard/resources/pipe_sprites.tres` - Configure with real assets
- `gameboard/scripts/Tile.gd` - Update sprite display logic

### 3. Sound Effects System üîä
- [ ] Add AudioStreamPlayer nodes to GameBoard scene
- [ ] Create sound effect resources (click, drag, remove, game over)
- [ ] Integrate sounds into GameState.gd play_sound() method
- [ ] Add sound triggers for tile clicks
- [ ] Add sound triggers for drag operations
- [ ] Add sound triggers for tile removal/fade
- [ ] Add sound trigger for game over
- [ ] Test volume levels and audio quality

**Files to Modify:**
- `gameboard/scenes/GameBoard.tscn` - Add AudioStreamPlayer nodes
- `gameboard/scripts/GameState.gd` - Integrate sound loading/playing
- `gameboard/scripts/GameBoard.gd` - Add sound triggers
- `gameboard/scripts/Tile.gd` - Add click sound triggers

### 4. Enhanced Visual Effects ‚ú®
- [ ] Improve fade animation quality (fix "weird" fade noted by user)
- [ ] Add particle effects for tile removal
- [ ] Enhance connection highlight effects
- [ ] Add visual feedback for chain reactions
- [ ] Improve drag indicator visuals
- [ ] Add smooth transitions for tile replacement

**Files to Modify:**
- `gameboard/resources/FadeSprites.gd` - Improve fade animation
- `gameboard/scripts/Tile.gd` - Enhanced visual effects
- `gameboard/scripts/GameBoard.gd` - Particle effects and highlights

### 5. Reward System Integration üéÅ
- [ ] Connect reward button to GameState reward system
- [ ] Implement tile randomization when reward is used
- [ ] Add visual feedback for reward activation
- [ ] Test reward costs moves correctly (-10 moves)
- [ ] Ensure reward system works with Android integration
- [ ] Add reward availability indicators

**Files to Modify:**
- `gameboard/scripts/GameState.gd` - Complete reward system implementation
- `gameboard/scripts/GameBoard.gd` - Add apply_deus_ex_machina() method
- `PlayScreen.gd` - Enhance reward button functionality

### 6. Performance Optimization ‚ö°
- [ ] Profile current performance and identify bottlenecks
- [ ] Optimize sprite rendering and animation systems
- [ ] Reduce unnecessary signal emissions
- [ ] Optimize connection detection algorithm if needed
- [ ] Test performance on target mobile devices
- [ ] Ensure consistent 60fps during complex animations

**Files to Monitor:**
- All script files - Performance optimization
- Resource files - Memory usage optimization

### 7. Final Integration Testing üß™
- [ ] Test complete game flow with all new features
- [ ] Verify animations don't break game mechanics
- [ ] Test sound effects don't cause performance issues
- [ ] Confirm reward system works end-to-end
- [ ] Test game over scenarios with new effects
- [ ] Verify mobile compatibility and performance

## Success Criteria

**Visual Polish:**
‚úÖ Smooth drag animations that feel responsive  
‚úÖ Proper pipe sprites from original assets  
‚úÖ Enhanced connection highlights and effects  
‚úÖ Particle effects for tile removal  

**Audio Integration:**
‚úÖ Sound effects for all major game interactions  
‚úÖ Audio doesn't interfere with performance  
‚úÖ Volume levels appropriate for mobile play  

**Reward System:**
‚úÖ Reward button fully functional  
‚úÖ Tile randomization works correctly  
‚úÖ Move cost (-10) applied properly  
‚úÖ Android integration points working  

**Performance:**
‚úÖ Consistent 60fps gameplay  
‚úÖ Smooth animations without stuttering  
‚úÖ Optimized for mobile devices  

## Testing Protocol

1. **Run PlayScreen.tscn** and verify all new features work
2. **Test smooth animations** during row/column dragging
3. **Verify sound effects** trigger correctly for all actions
4. **Test reward system** functionality and visual feedback
5. **Check performance** with continuous gameplay
6. **Validate mobile compatibility** and touch responsiveness

## Dependencies

- Phase 6 must be complete and working
- Original pipe sprite assets must be available
- Sound effect assets must be prepared
- Mobile testing environment available
