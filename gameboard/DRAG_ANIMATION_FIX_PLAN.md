# Drag Animation Fix Plan

## Root Problems Identified

1. **Data Mismatch in Drag Completion Signal**: The `DragHandler` emits a signal without `drag_direction`, but `GameBoard._on_drag_completed()` expects it. This causes `drag_direction` to always be `Vector2.ZERO`, preventing any rotations.

2. **Early State Reset**: The drag state is reset before the completion signal is processed, making the `drag_direction` inaccessible during animation calculations.

3. **Missing Animation Coordination**: The animation system can't properly track the drag direction because the state is cleared too early.

## Specific Issues Found

- **DragHandler.gd:117** emits only `{state, from, to}` but **GameBoard.gd:98** expects `drag_direction`
- **DragHandler.gd:114** resets state before signal emission, breaking animation access
- Animation positioning calculations happen after state reset, causing incorrect visual feedback

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Fix Drag Completion Signal Data (DragHandler.gd)
- Add `drag_direction` to the emitted `drag_info` dictionary
- Move `reset_drag_state()` to happen AFTER signal emission 
- Ensure all necessary data is available when GameBoard processes the drag

### 2. Update GameBoard Drag Processing (GameBoard.gd)  
- Remove fallback to `Vector2.ZERO` for drag_direction since it will now be properly provided
- Add validation that drag_direction is present before processing rotation
- Ensure rotation calculations use the correct coordinate system

### 3. Coordinate Animation State (AnimationManager.gd)
- Ensure animated positions are calculated with correct drag direction
- Verify animation positioning uses consistent coordinate system
- Fix any remaining visual feedback issues during drag operations

### 4. Testing & Validation
- Test horizontal row dragging with visual feedback
- Test vertical column dragging with visual feedback  
- Verify array rotation matches animation direction
- Confirm smooth drag-to-rotation transitions

## Expected Outcome

This focused 4-step plan addresses the core data flow issue preventing proper drag interactions while maintaining the existing component architecture. After implementation, dragging should work smoothly with proper visual feedback and correct array rotations.
