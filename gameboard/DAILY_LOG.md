# Daily Development Log - August 7, 2025

## Today's Work Summary

### Fixed Drag Animation Issues ✅
Successfully resolved core drag animation problems that were preventing proper row/column rotation:

1. **Signal Data Fix** - Fixed `DragHandler.gd` to include `drag_direction` in completion signal
2. **State Management** - Moved `reset_drag_state()` after signal emission to preserve drag data
3. **GameBoard Integration** - Removed fallback to `Vector2.ZERO` in drag processing
4. **Animation Coordination** - Fixed AnimationManager position calculations

### Technical Details
- **Root Cause**: `DragHandler` was resetting state before emitting completion signal, causing `drag_direction` to be lost
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `DragHandler.gd` - Fixed signal emission timing and data
  - `GameBoard.gd` - Updated drag processing logic
  - `AnimationManager.gd` - Coordinated animation state properly

### Testing Results
- ✅ Horizontal row dragging now works with proper visual feedback
- ✅ Vertical column dragging now works with proper visual feedback
- ✅ Array rotations match animation directions correctly
- ✅ Smooth drag-to-rotation transitions functioning

### Current Status
**Phase 7 - Drag Animation Polish** is now substantially complete. The core dragging mechanics are working correctly with proper visual feedback and array rotation synchronization.

## Next Phase Priorities
1. Load actual pipe sprite assets from `linkage/imgs/`
2. Add sound effects for game interactions
3. Implement proper reward system with tile randomization
4. Add particle effects and visual polish
5. Optimize for 60fps performance

## Architecture Notes
The component-based architecture proved effective for debugging - isolating the signal timing issue to `DragHandler.gd` allowed for a focused fix without disrupting other systems.

## File Structure Status
All component files remain clean and well-separated:
- GameBoard.gd (165 lines) - Main coordinator
- BoardManager.gd (77 lines) - Board/tile management  
- RotationHandler.gd (89 lines) - Array rotation logic
- AnimationManager.gd (176 lines) - Visual feedback system
- ConnectionManager.gd (88 lines) - Connection detection
- DragHandler.gd - Input processing (now working correctly)
