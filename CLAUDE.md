# Claude Code Memory - Linkage Remake

## Project Overview
Converting JavaScript HTML5 Canvas Linkage game to Godot 4 in incremental phases. Each phase produces a runnable game for immediate testing.

## Testing Guidelines
- Always let me test the program myself

## Completed Phases âœ… 
**Phases 1-7 Complete:** Game is fully functional with complete game loop, animations, scoring, and component-based architecture.

### Core Game Features Working:
âœ… Complete 6x8 tile grid with pipe symbols  
âœ… Click and drag rows/columns with visual feedback  
âœ… Connection detection with green highlights  
âœ… Tile fade animations and removal  
âœ… Real-time score tracking (+1 per tile) with instant UI updates  
âœ… Real-time moves tracking (-1 per drag) with instant UI updates  
âœ… Chain reactions and bonus moves (1 per 3 tiles removed)  
âœ… Game over detection with dialog when moves = 0  
âœ… Reset/restart functionality through GameState  
âœ… Complete game loop functional end-to-end  

### Architecture Achievements:
âœ… **GameState Autoload** - Centralized game state management
âœ… **Signal-Based UI** - Real-time updates via GameState signals
âœ… **Component Architecture** - GameBoard split into specialized managers:
- **BoardManager.gd** - Board/tile management
- **RotationHandler.gd** - Row/column rotation logic  
- **ConnectionManager.gd** - Connection detection/highlighting
- **DragHandler.gd** - Drag input handling
âœ… **Responsive Design** - Dynamic tile sizing based on screen dimensions


## Current Phase - UI/UX Polish & Advanced Scoring âœ… IN PROGRESS
**Goal:** Improve visual feedback and implement advanced scoring mechanics

### Completed Tasks:
âœ… **Drag Freeze During Animations** - Implemented in ConnectionManager.gd
- Blocks new drags when fade animations start
- Cancels active drags during fade animations  
- Re-enables dragging when all fades complete

âœ… **Screen Resize Fix** - Fixed tile duplication issue during viewport resizing
- Replaced board reinitialization with tile position/size updates
- Added update_size() method to Tile class
- Prevents multiple overlapping tile grids

âœ… **New Tileset Visual Assets** - Upgraded tile graphics
- Implemented improved visual tileset

âœ… **Better Button Design** - Enhanced button styling and appearance

### Remaining Tasks:
ðŸ”„ **Visual Clicking Feedback** - Make clicking more obvious
ðŸ”„ **Advanced Scoring System** - Design multi-factor scoring:
  - Extra points for tile usage patterns
  - Corner-based scoring bonuses  
  - Chain reaction multipliers
ðŸ”„ **UI/UX Improvements** - General interface polish
- we need an icon for android.
- we need custom splash screen
- todo: organize the data needed related to tilesets and pack them into a settings file.
