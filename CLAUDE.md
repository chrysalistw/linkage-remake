# Claude Code Memory - Linkage Remake

## Project Overview
Converting JavaScript HTML5 Canvas Linkage game to Godot 4 in incremental phases. Each phase produces a runnable game for immediate testing.

## Testing Guidelines
- Always let me test the program myself

## Phase 6 Implementation Status ✅ COMPLETED
**Goal:** Complete game loop with moves/scoring/game over UI integration

### All Phase 6 Tasks Completed:
1. ✅ **GameState Autoload Configuration** - Added to project.godot as global singleton
2. ✅ **PlayScreen UI Integration** - Connected to GameState signals for real-time updates
3. ✅ **Real-time Score/Moves Display** - UI updates instantly during gameplay
4. ✅ **Game Over Detection** - Dialog appears automatically when moves = 0
5. ✅ **Button Integration** - Reset/restart functionality through GameState methods
6. ✅ **Single Source of Truth** - All game state managed centrally through GameState

### Implementation Notes:
- **UI Integration Complete**: Score and moves now update in real-time during gameplay
- **Signal-Based Architecture**: PlayScreen connects to GameState.moves_changed, score_changed, game_lost signals
- **Button Reference Fix**: Fixed node path issues for ControlButtons (was crashing on game over)
- **Autoload Singleton**: GameState properly configured and accessible globally

### Files Modified:
- `project.godot` - Added GameState autoload configuration
- `PlayScreen.gd` - Removed duplicate state, connected to GameState signals, integrated button handlers
- `gameboard/scripts/GameState.gd` - Removed class_name conflict, cleaned up JavaScript bridge code
- `gameboard/scripts/GameBoard.gd` - Fixed GameState.instance references to use autoload directly

### Current Game Features Working:
✅ Complete 6x8 tile grid with pipe symbols  
✅ Click and drag rows/columns with visual feedback  
✅ Connection detection with green highlights  
✅ Tile fade animations and removal  
✅ **Real-time score tracking** (+1 per tile) with instant UI updates  
✅ **Real-time moves tracking** (-1 per drag) with instant UI updates  
✅ Chain reactions and bonus moves (1 per 3 tiles removed)  
✅ **Game over detection** with dialog when moves = 0  
✅ **Reset/restart functionality** through GameState  
✅ **Complete game loop** functional end-to-end  

## Phase 7 Status 🔧 IN PROGRESS - Drag Animation Polish
**Goal:** Polish & Features - Smooth animations, proper sprites, sound effects

### Drag Animation Progress:
✅ **Direction Detection Fixed** - Resolved coordinate system mismatch in DragHandler.gd  
✅ **Visual Polish** - Removed unwanted red arrow indicator  
🚨 **Active Issues** - Animation direction and array rotation need investigation  

### Remaining Phase 7 Tasks:
- 🔧 Debug animation direction issues
- 🔧 Fix array rotation logic
- ⏳ Load actual pipe sprite assets from linkage/imgs/
- ⏳ Add sound effects for all game interactions
- ⏳ Implement proper reward system with tile randomization
- ⏳ Add particle effects and visual polish
- ⏳ Optimize for 60fps performance

### Code Maintenance Status:
✅ **GameBoard.gd Refactored** - Successfully split 529-line file into 5 component managers

## GameBoard Refactoring ✅ COMPLETED
**Successfully split 529-line GameBoard.gd into component-based architecture:**

### Component Managers Created:
- **BoardManager.gd** (77 lines) - Board initialization, tile creation/management
- **RotationHandler.gd** (89 lines) - Row/column rotation logic
- **AnimationManager.gd** (176 lines) - Drag animations, visual feedback, position caching  
- **ConnectionManager.gd** (88 lines) - Connection detection, highlighting, fade processing
- **GameBoard.gd** (165 lines) - Main coordinator with delegation methods

### Refactoring Benefits:
- **69% reduction** in main file complexity (529→165 lines)
- **Single responsibility principle** applied to each component
- **Clean separation of concerns** for better maintainability
- **Preserved all functionality** - game works exactly as before
- **Proper delegation methods** for backward compatibility

**Additional Files:**
- `project.godot` ✅ GameState configured as autoload singleton
- `PlayScreen.gd` ✅ Connected to GameState signals for real-time UI updates

## Key Implementation Patterns:
- **Incremental Development**: Each phase kept game runnable for immediate testing
- **Signal-Based Architecture**: GameState emits signals, UI components connect for real-time updates  
- **Autoload Singleton**: GameState provides single source of truth for all game state
- **Component-Based Architecture**: GameBoard orchestrates specialized manager components
- **Delegation Methods**: Backward compatibility maintained through delegation to components
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each component handles one specific domain
- **Batch Processing**: Track multiple fade completions for chain reactions
- **Defensive Programming**: Null checks and error handling throughout

## Testing Protocol:
- Each phase must be fully functional before proceeding
- Real-time UI updates confirmed during gameplay
- Game over and restart functionality verified
- Complete game loop tested end-to-end
