# Claude Code Memory - Linkage Remake

## Project Overview
Converting JavaScript HTML5 Canvas Linkage game to Godot 4 in incremental phases. Each phase produces a runnable game for immediate testing.

## Testing Guidelines
- Always let me test the program myself

## Completed Phases ✅ 
**Phases 1-7 Complete:** Game is fully functional with complete game loop, animations, scoring, and component-based architecture.

### Core Game Features Working:
✅ Complete 6x8 tile grid with pipe symbols  
✅ Click and drag rows/columns with visual feedback  
✅ Connection detection with green highlights  
✅ Tile fade animations and removal  
✅ Real-time score tracking (+1 per tile) with instant UI updates  
✅ Real-time moves tracking (-1 per drag) with instant UI updates  
✅ Chain reactions and bonus moves (1 per 3 tiles removed)  
✅ Game over detection with dialog when moves = 0  
✅ Reset/restart functionality through GameState  
✅ Complete game loop functional end-to-end  

### Architecture Achievements:
✅ **GameState Autoload** - Centralized game state management
✅ **Signal-Based UI** - Real-time updates via GameState signals
✅ **Component Architecture** - GameBoard split into specialized managers:
- **BoardManager.gd** - Board/tile management
- **RotationHandler.gd** - Row/column rotation logic  
- **ConnectionManager.gd** - Connection detection/highlighting
- **DragHandler.gd** - Drag input handling
✅ **Responsive Design** - Dynamic tile sizing based on screen dimensions


## Current Phase - UI/UX Polish & Advanced Scoring ✅ IN PROGRESS
**Goal:** Improve visual feedback and implement advanced scoring mechanics

### Completed Tasks:
✅ **Drag Freeze During Animations** - Implemented in ConnectionManager.gd
- Blocks new drags when fade animations start
- Cancels active drags during fade animations  
- Re-enables dragging when all fades complete

✅ **Screen Resize Fix** - Fixed tile duplication issue during viewport resizing
- Replaced board reinitialization with tile position/size updates
- Added update_size() method to Tile class
- Prevents multiple overlapping tile grids

✅ **New Tileset Visual Assets** - Upgraded tile graphics
- Implemented improved visual tileset

✅ **Better Button Design** - Enhanced button styling and appearance

✅ **TilesetSelection Screen Redesign** - Complete mobile-friendly layout overhaul
- Removed complex ContentPanel wrapper for cleaner design
- Added dedicated TitlePanel with theme-aware styling (rounded corners, accent borders)
- Enhanced title with proper centering and 80px height container
- Enlarged Back button to 200x60px for better touch accessibility
- Improved grid spacing from 20px to 30px for better visual separation
- Responsive 60px margins adapt to different screen sizes
- Theme-aware panel styling with dynamic colors based on selected theme

### Next Priority Tasks:
🔄 **Visual Clicking Feedback** - Make clicking more obvious
🔄 **Advanced Scoring System** - Design multi-factor scoring:
  - Extra points for tile usage patterns
  - Corner-based scoring bonuses  
  - Chain reaction multipliers
🔄 **Mobile App Preparation**:
  - Create Android app icon
  - Design custom splash screen  
  - Organize tileset data into settings file structure
- 動畫的最後一格要是空白的!
- 遊戲功能和admob整合
- VFX
- 金幣/鑽石系統
- 減小MVP規模,減小更新規模,增加更新頻率
