# Claude Code Memory - Linkage Remake

## Project Overview
Converting JavaScript HTML5 Canvas Linkage game to Godot 4 in incremental phases. Each phase produces a runnable game for immediate testing.

## Phase 5 Implementation Status ✅ COMPLETED
**Goal:** Remove connected tiles with fade animations, scoring, chain reactions, and moves integration

### All 5 Tasks Completed:
1. ✅ **Green Fade Animation Resource** - Created FadeSprites.gd + green_fade_sprites.tres using green_fade.png (5 frames)
2. ✅ **Fade Animation in Tile.gd** - Added start_fade_animation(), fade_completed signal, timer-based frame progression
3. ✅ **Connection Detection Integration** - Connected fade animations to connection detection in GameBoard.gd
4. ✅ **Tile Replacement & Scoring** - Tiles replaced with random faces after fade, +1 score per tile
5. ✅ **Chain Reactions & Moves** - Moves counting per drag, bonus moves (1 per 3 tiles), game over detection

### Implementation Notes:
- **Fade Animation Issues**: User noted "fade animation is weird" but acceptable for now
- **Scoring/Moves Display**: User noted "score and moves are not working, or it's just the board that are not updating" - backend logic implemented correctly but UI not showing updates
- **Console Output Working**: All debug messages show proper game mechanics in console

### Files Modified:
- `gameboard/resources/FadeSprites.gd` - NEW: Fade animation resource script
- `gameboard/resources/green_fade_sprites.tres` - NEW: Fade sprites resource file
- `gameboard/scripts/Tile.gd` - Added fade animation methods and signals
- `gameboard/scripts/GameBoard.gd` - Added fade integration, scoring, moves counting, game over handling
- `gameboard/scripts/GameState.gd` - Already existed with proper backend logic

### Current Game Mechanics Working:
✅ Connected tiles fade out using green_fade.png frames  
✅ New random tiles appear after fade completes  
✅ Score increases correctly in backend (+1 per removed tile)  
✅ Moves decrease by 1 per drag operation in backend  
✅ Chain reactions work automatically  
✅ Bonus moves awarded (1 per 3 tiles removed)  
✅ Game over detection when moves = 0

## Next Phase: UI Integration
**Issue to Address:** Score and moves tracking working in backend but not displaying in UI
- GameState.score and GameState.moves_left updating correctly
- Need to connect UI elements to display these values
- Console debug shows all mechanics working properly

```

## Key Implementation Patterns:
- **Incremental Development**: Each task kept game runnable for testing
- **Signal-Based Architecture**: Tiles emit fade_completed, GameBoard handles via signals
- **GameState Integration**: All scoring/moves go through GameState singleton
- **Batch Processing**: Track multiple fade completions for chain reactions
- **Console Debugging**: Extensive debug output for tracking game mechanics

## Testing Protocol:
- Stop after each task completion
- User tests before proceeding to next task
- Game must remain fully functional at each step
- Console output validates backend mechanics are working
